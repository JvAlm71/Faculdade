# Codes and Works

-In this repository, I will store my codes created for college to maintain a portfolio and demonstrate my skills in certain languages and situations proposed by the professors. Below, I will describe what is currently in each folder:

## It's worth noting that for each project shown, within their folders are their respective explanations, so please enter and view them properly.

# Numerical Calculus:

Language: Python

-For numerical calculus, most problems alternated between mathematical questions and situations where, through programming, we could solve them. Using .ipynb, we solved problems based on mathematical fundamentals. The development of these works was of great importance for learning Python and its applications through the use of libraries.

# Data Structures:

Language: C

-For this subject, there were some assignments, for now, it only has the sorting algorithms work, which is in a makefile.

# Introduction to Computer Science:

Language: C++

-For this course, a game was developed in C++, however, this subject was largely taught in C, but for this game, C++ was better as it involves a game, and C++ facilitates the manipulation of the game. Of course, it is a game using very basic programming concepts, as this subject was taken in my first year of undergraduate studies, but it already demonstrates a considerable use of functions and concepts. The game in question was based on the famous board game WAR, and it is fully playable.

# Internet of Things:

Language: C++, Arduino, Docker, SQL

In this course, I developed an IoT project to create a device using ESP-32 to monitor the humidity and temperature of one of the USP laboratories. In the IoT folder, the documentation used in the work will be better specified. This work encompasses a wide range of knowledge, VERY COMPLETE. The folder will contain the entire documented work, completely.

# Digital Systems Laboratory:

Language: VHDL

In this course, I developed machine-oriented programming using Quartus. The final goal was to combine all the developed codes to synthesize in a processor. The folder will contain the respective PDFs of each practice and a portfolio of development in the machine language VHDL.

# Organization and Architecture of Computers:

Language: Assembly

In this course, 2 projects were developed, one related to a game in assembly and another to instructions for a processor of our professor in the course, both projects helped to develop the ability to understand the hierarchical structure of a computer.
