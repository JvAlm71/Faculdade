## Cálculo Númerico

For this course, the Professor proposed 3 assignments to solve problems through programming. We used Python, demonstrating numerical methods for resolution. In each folder of each assignment, you will find the descriptive PDF of the work and the code used by my group for development. The more "RAW" mathematical part of the work was implemented by the professor, however, the methods of resolution using Python were completely developed by the group!!
